#Wesleyan Meal and Points Budgeting App

This project is a react webapp designed to help Wesleyan students keep track of their meal and points spending as well as suggest whether they should spend more or less.

## Login

Allows the user to login with their wesleyan credentials and pulls data from transact to budget their spending.
(currently, to test the webapp, we have temporary users set up with mock data. This will be replaced with API requests once we have access to the transact data)

## Dashboard

This is the main page on which we display all of the user's spending/swiping information as well as predictions for future spending.

### Predictive Dial

This dial predicts the future spending of the user and compares it to what they should be spending to end the semester will out exceeding their point limit.

### Periodic Limit

In this component, the user will be able to see how much they have spent in a day/week/2 weeks, and how much they should be spending in that time period.

### Charted Transactions

This is a graph of the spending in the last 30 days. This data is also used to formulate a prediction of the user's future spending using a exponentially weighted average.




# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
